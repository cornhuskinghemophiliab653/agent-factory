# Agent Factory

**84 production-ready AI agent prompts + generators that create more. Not just prompts — a self-expanding library.**

> Most "awesome prompt" repos give you static text files. Agent Factory gives you a complete system: curated agent prompts, industry playbooks, a growing glossary, department guides, and **generators that create fresh content using free LLM APIs.**

## The Playbooks (20 industries)

Real-world AI adoption guides for: Healthcare, Financial Services, Retail, Manufacturing, Education, Legal, Real Estate, Agriculture, Energy, Logistics, Media, Hospitality, Insurance, Telecom, Government, Nonprofit, Construction, Automotive, Pharma, and Cybersecurity.

Each playbook includes:
- Industry summary
- 5 concrete use cases with descriptions
- 5 key takeaways (practical, not theoretical)
- Recommended agents from the library

## The Generators (the real differentiator)

Static prompt libraries go stale. Agent Factory **generates fresh content** using free LLM APIs.

### Setup

```bash
cd generators
cp .env.example .env
# Add at least one API key (all providers are free tier)
pip install python-dotenv requests google-genai groq cerebras-cloud-sdk
```

### Generate new agent prompts

```bash
python generate_bonus_prompts.py                    # all departments
python generate_bonus_prompts.py --department=sales  # one department
python generate_bonus_prompts.py --dry-run           # preview first
```

### Generate department guides

```bash
python generate_dept_guides.py              # refresh oldest guide
python generate_dept_guides.py --all        # generate all 12
python generate_dept_guides.py --dry-run    # preview
```

### Expand the glossary

```bash
python generate_glossary_terms.py            # add 5 new terms
python generate_glossary_terms.py --count=10 # add 10 terms
python generate_glossary_terms.py --dry-run  # preview
```

### LLM Provider Fallback

The generators use a multi-provider fallback chain — if one provider is rate-limited, it automatically tries the next:

```
Cerebras → Groq → Gemini → SambaNova → Cloudflare Workers AI
```

All providers offer free tiers. You only need **one** API key to get started.

## Quality Gates (bonus)

Production-tested quality tools extracted from a multi-site deployment pipeline. Each script is standalone with zero external dependencies (stdlib only).

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `html_invariants.py` | Checks title, viewport, meta desc, canonical, OG tags, JSON-LD, broken links, broken images, placeholder text |
| `banned_patterns.py` | Scans for hardcoded secrets, debug statements, placeholder text |
| `smoke_test.py` | Concurrent HTTP health checks with content verification |
| `validate_jsonld.py` | Deep JSON-LD validation (required fields per schema type) |
| `check_imports.py` | AST-based Python import checker (no code execution) |
| `pre-commit-hook` | Git hook that catches secrets and debug code before commit |

Install the pre-commit hook:
```bash
ln -sf $(pwd)/quality-gates/pre-commit-hook .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

---

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Just use the prompts

Open `agents/agents_data.json`, find an agent, copy the `prompt` field into your AI tool.

### Option 2: Use as Claude Code agents

```bash
# Copy agents to Claude Code's agent directory
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
# Then use agents_data.json to create individual .md files per agent
```

### Option 3: Run the generators

```bash
cd generators
cp .env.example .env
# Add your free API key(s)
pip install python-dotenv requests
python generate_bonus_prompts.py --dry-run
```

## How This Was Built

This library was extracted from a production AI pipeline that runs daily across 7+ websites. Every prompt has been tested in real workflows. The generators have been running weekly for months, creating fresh content without human intervention.

Built by [Peter Saddington](https://github.com/agilepeter) — 4+ years of building AI systems, from single prompts to autonomous multi-agent pipelines.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo
2. Add or improve an agent in `agents_data.json`
3. Run the generators to verify your changes don't break anything
4. Open a PR with a clear description

Agent prompts should be:
- **Practical** — someone can copy-paste and get immediate value
- **Specific** — not "you are a helpful assistant"
- **150-300 words** — enough detail to be useful, short enough to be fast
- **Include deliverables** — what does this agent actually produce?
